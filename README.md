## Hi, I'm Evgeniia
### About me

I'm a QA engineer with a strong command of both manual and automated testing. I'm a quick learner and always eager to master new skills and technologies. 
I worked in international companies for over 6 years so my soft skills are on point, just as my English. I am also quite fun to be around.
